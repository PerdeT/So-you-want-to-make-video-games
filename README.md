# So you want to make video games?

## Here’s all the resources you’re gonna need

Hi! I'm [Borb](https://twitter.com/oggborbis), I make [video games](https://borbware.itch.io/) and [music](https://soundcloud.com/oggborbis), at least after I've finished my master's.

I also want **you** to learn how to make video games!! Because you don't need a master's thesis for that!!

This wiki contains bits and pieces of information I’ve come across during my Gamedev years. Everything’s neatly mapped into five six sections:

1. [Which engine should you use?](https://github.com/PerdeT/So-you-want-to-make-video-games/wiki/1.-Which-engine-should-I-use%3F)
2. Game Design
3. Game Programming, general
4. Graphics, audio, music
5. Actually starting a game project
