# So you want to make video games

I'm [Borb](https://twitter.com/oggborbis)! I make [video games](https://borbware.itch.io/) and sometimes [video gamey music](https://soundcloud.com/oggborbis) , or at least would if I had already finished my master's thesis...

Even more importantly, I also want **you** to learn how to make video games!! Because apparently, you don't need a master's thesis for that!!

The resources I've gathered for you are located on this repo's [wiki](https://github.com/borbware/So-you-want-to-make-video-games/wiki), the repository itself doesn't contain anything meaningful yet (maybe I'll upload some example files in the future!)
