# So you want to make video games

## Here’s all the resources you’re gonna need

I'm [Borb](https://twitter.com/oggborbis)! I make [video games](https://borbware.itch.io/) and [music](https://soundcloud.com/oggborbis) (at least after I've finished with my master's).

Even more importantly, I also want **you** to learn how to make video games!! Because apparently, you don't need a master's thesis for that!!

Everything is on this repo's [wiki](wiki), the repository itself doesn't contain anything meaningful yet (maybe some example files in the future!)
