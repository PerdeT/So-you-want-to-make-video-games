# So you want to make video games

## Here’s all the resources you’re gonna need

I'm [Borb](https://twitter.com/oggborbis)! I make [video games](https://borbware.itch.io/) and [music](https://soundcloud.com/oggborbis) (at least after I've finished with my master's).

Even more importantly, I also want **you** to learn how to make video games!! Because apparently, you don't need a master's thesis for that!!

This wiki contains bits and pieces of information I’ve come across during my gamedev years. Everything’s neatly mapped into six sections (might change this soon, though):

1. [Which engine should I use?](Which-engine-should-I-use%3F)
2. [Game design](Game-design)
3. [Game programming](Game-programming)
4. [Graphics](Graphics)
5. [Audio](Audio)
6. [Advanced topics](Advanced-topics)
